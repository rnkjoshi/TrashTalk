<h1>Definition</h1>
This is a chat application where people can create their own room and invite other friends over using <i>WhatsApp or Email</i> invites.
The Purpose behind building this project is trash talking. There are always some people in every group who ruin group chats with messages of no concern.
So, this platform is for those type of people. Here they can do whatever trash talk they want to do and the platform will leave no traces once you leave the room.
